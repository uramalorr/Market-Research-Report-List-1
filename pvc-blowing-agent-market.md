<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Blowing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exothermic Blowing Agent</li><li>Endothermic Blowing Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PVC blowing agent market is primarily divided into two types: exothermic and endothermic blowing agents. Exothermic blowing agents release heat during the reaction, leading to the expansion of PVC materials, creating lightweight and durable foams. They are ideal for applications requiring improved thermal insulation. In contrast, endothermic blowing agents absorb heat, resulting in a cooling effect that expands the PVC upon activation. This type is suitable for products needing lower densities and finer cellular structures, enhancing flexibility and surface finish.</p></p>
