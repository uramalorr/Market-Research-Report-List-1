<p><h1>Drywall & Building Plaster Market Size 2025 - 2032 Global Industrial Analysis, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Drywall & Building Plaster Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Drywall, also known as gypsum board or plasterboard, is a panel made of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) sandwiched between thick paper sheets. It is widely used in construction for creating walls and ceilings due to its ease of installation, fire resistance, and soundproofing properties. Building plaster, on the other hand, is a material used for coating walls and ceilings to provide a smooth, durable finish. It is typically made from gypsum, lime, or cement and is applied in a paste form that hardens over time.</p><p>The Drywall & Building Plaster Market is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing construction activities, urbanization, and the demand for cost-effective and sustainable building materials. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% during the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the rising adoption of drywall in residential, commercial, and industrial projects due to its lightweight nature, energy efficiency, and recyclability.</p><p>Emerging trends in the market include the development of eco-friendly and fire-resistant drywall products, as well as advancements in plaster formulations for enhanced durability and aesthetic appeal. Additionally, the growing preference for prefabricated construction methods is boosting the demand for drywall. Regions such as Asia-Pacific and North America are leading the market expansion, driven by rapid infrastructure development and increasing investments in construction projects.</p></p>
