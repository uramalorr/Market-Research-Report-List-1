<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Juicer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tradtional Juice Extractor</li><li>Slow Juicer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The juicer market is primarily divided into two types: traditional juice extractors and slow juicers. Traditional juice extractors, often centrifugal, use high-speed blades to rapidly extract juice, preserving bright flavors but causing some nutrient loss due to heat. In contrast, slow juicers, or masticating juicers, operate at lower speeds, crushing fruits and vegetables to maximize nutrient retention and yield. While traditional extractors appeal to those seeking convenience, slow juicers attract health-conscious consumers prioritizing nutrient density and juice quality.</p></p>
